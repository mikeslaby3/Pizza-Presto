# Pizza Presto v1.0

Pizza Presto is an interactive game where you help Chef Mario build pizzas at his 5-star Pizza Restaurant by answering trivia questions. Each question answered correctly adds an ingredient to the pizza. Choose between easy, medium, or hard difficulty. 

Trivia questions pulled from [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) and chef jokes pulled from [Random Joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/).
